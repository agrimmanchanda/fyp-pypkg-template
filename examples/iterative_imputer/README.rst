Iterative Imputer
====================

Aim: The aim of this experiment is to investigate Machine Learning Based imputation methods using an experimental feature from Scikit-learn called Iterative Imputer using two sub-experiments: (a) single and (b) multiple feature removal (10%, 30% and 50%).

This page contains experiment results as follows:

Experiment 1: Single Feature Removal (model learning and evaluation)

Experiment 2: Multiple Feature Removal (model learning and evaluation)

Experiment 3 (1 and 2): Hyperparameter tuning for Experiment 1 and 2

Experiment 4: Single and Multiple Feature removal with ML methods discretised (model learning and evaluation).
